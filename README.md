A basic workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) to check your battery level, and report it in a notification

## About

A simple workflow for quickly reporting the current battery level in a notification.   
This workflow is deliberately simple as all I wanted was an easy way to quickly check my battery.

## System Requirements
- [Alfred v5.0.0 of newer](https://alfredapp.com)  
- MacOS Sonoma 14.0 (23A344)  
**May work on older versions of MacOS but hasn't been tested.**

## Installation
1. From the [Releases](https://github.com/aarblaster/alfredBattery/releases) page download the alfredBattery.alfredworkflow file.
2. Open the downloaded file in Alfred.
3. You can change the trigger with the configuration window in the Alfred Workflow settings. 

For more information about Alfred workflows, you can [visit the Alfred workflows site](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/).

## Usage
Simply type `bbl` in your Alfred toolbar to see the current battery level in a notification.  
You can modify the default keyword from the `Configure` menu.

## Contributions
If you have ideas or contributions I'm very interested. I'm really new to coding and making it up as I go, so suggestions are welcome.   
If you encounter a problem you can raise and issue using the issue tab on Github.

## Licence 
This project uses: MIT Licence.  
The licence is designed to allow you to edit, change and use the software fairly permissively.
