# Battery Level

A basic workflow for Alfred to check your battery level.

## About

A simple workflow to quickly report the current battery level in a notification.
If your Mac is not on battery power the notification will say "Not on battery power.".
  
This workflow is deliberately simple as all I wanted was an easy way to quickly check my battery.
