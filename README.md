# Battery Level

A basic workflow for Alfred to check your battery level.

## About

A simple battery checking workflow to quickly report the current battery level in a notification.
If your Mac is not on battery power it will report that is not currently on battery power.

This workflow is deliberately simple as all I wanted was an easy way to quick check my battery.
