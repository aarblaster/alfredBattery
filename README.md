A basic workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) to check your battery level, and report it in a notification

## About

A simple workflow for quickly reporting the current battery level in a notification.   
This workflow is deliberately simple as all I wanted was an easy way to quickly check my battery.

## System Requirements
- [Alfred v5.0.0 of newer](https://alfredapp.com)  
- MacOS Sonoma 14.0 (23A344)  
**May work on older versions of MacOS but hasn't been tested.**

## Installation
1. From the [Releases](https://github.com/aarblaster/alfredBattery/releases) page download the `alfredBattery.alfredworkflow` file. Or download from the [Alfred Workflow Library](https://alfred.app/workflows/aarblaster/battery-level/)
2. Open the downloaded file in Alfred.

For more information about Alfred workflows, you can [visit the Alfred workflows site](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/).
