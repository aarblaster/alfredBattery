A basic workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) to check your battery level, and report it in a notification

## About

A simple workflow to quickly report the current battery level in a notification.
If your Mac is not on battery power the notification will say "Not on battery power.".
  
This workflow is deliberately simple as all I wanted was an easy way to quickly check my battery.

## System Requirements

[Alfred v5.0.0 of newer](https://alfredapp.com)  
MacOS Sonoma 14.0 (23A344)  
**May work on older versions of MacOS but hasn't been tested.**

## Installation
- From the [Releases](https://github.com/aarblaster/alfredBattery/releases) page download the alfredBattery.alfredworkflow file.
- Follow the instructions [here](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/) to install in Alfred.

## Usage
Simply type `bbl` in your Alfred toolbar to see the current battery level in a notification.  
You can modify the default keyword from the `Configure` menu.
